    "By completing this assignment you will:\n",
    "- Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.\n",
    "- Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.\n",
    "- Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time to build your first neural network, which will have a hidden layer. You will see a big difference between this model and the one you implemented using logistic regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "**You will learn how to:**\n",
    "- Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer\n",
    "- Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh \n",
    "- Compute the cross entropy loss \n",
    "- Implement forward and backward propagation"
